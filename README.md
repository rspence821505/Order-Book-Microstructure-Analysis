# Order-Book-Microstructure-Analysis

<!-- # Limit Order Book Feature Pipeline & Tree-Based Prediction -->

> End-to-end pipeline for engineering microstructure features, detecting market regimes, and predicting mid-price direction using tree-based models.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project demonstrates:

- Engineering 45+ microstructure features from limit order book data
- Hawkes process modeling for order flow dynamics
- Multi-method regime detection (HMM + Hawkes)
- Tree-based prediction models (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting)
- Comprehensive model interpretability (SHAP, permutation importance, partial dependence)
- Regime-conditional modeling and economic validation

**Key Results:**

<!-- - 68% directional accuracy (vs. 53% baseline)
- 22% Sharpe ratio improvement with regime-aware trading
- Sub-400Î¼s inference latency for production deployment -->
